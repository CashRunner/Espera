# TODO

- Playback without playlists
- When clicking on the "previous song" button, the previous song should be played only if the current song hasn't passed 3 (5?) seconds. Otherwise, it should restart the current song. This is the common behavior in most music players.
- Option to update the library (remove tracks that are not on the harddrive anymore)
- Show YouTube video, not only the audio track (this should be toggleable via a button)
- Show a different message when a song is missing on the physical drive (currently it says that the song is corrupt)
- Handle songs from a removable drive in a playlist when the application is started, but the original path doesn't exists anymore
- Possibility to repeat the playlist or the song
