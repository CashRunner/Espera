## Overview

Espera is an open-source media player that plays MP3s, WAV files and YouTube videos and has a special "party mode".

## Features

### Party-Mode

In the party-mode Espera allows to lock itself if the guests shouldn't be able to change the volume or stop the music, 
but still be able to add songs to the playlist.

### YouTube

Espera can search songs at YouTube, add them to the playlist and download/stream the audio track.

When adding songs from YouTube to the playlist the video gets silently downloaded in the background, or optionally get streamed immediately.

### Mp3-players & removable devices

Espera has built-in support for adding music from MP3-players and other removable devices to the playlist.
The music that is added to the playlist will be automatically cached on the computer, so that the devices can be removed
without affecting the playback.

### Metro (Modern UI)-Style

Espera uses [MahApps.Metro](http://github.com/MahApps/MahApps.Metro) for theming. This gives Espera a beautiful and 
very clean look.

## Requirements

 - .NET Framework 4.0
 - Windows 8, Windows 7, Windows Vista
 - Windows XP only works with the portable version of Espera

## Development

Espera is written in C#, with WPF as frontend.
