## Overview

**This is the development branch of the soon to be released version 2.0 of Espera**

Espera is an open-source media player that plays audio files and YouTube videos and has a special "party mode".

## Features

### Party-Mode

In the party-mode Espera allows to lock itself if the guests shouldn't be able to change the volume or stop the music, 
but still be able to add songs to the playlist.

### YouTube

Espera can search songs at YouTube, add them to the playlist and download/stream the audio track.

When adding songs from YouTube to the playlist the video gets silently downloaded in the background, or optionally get streamed immediately.

### Metro (Modern UI)-Style

Espera uses [MahApps.Metro](http://github.com/MahApps/MahApps.Metro) for theming. This gives Espera a beautiful and 
very clean look.

## Requirements

 - .NET Framework 4.5
 - Windows 8, Windows 7, Windows Vista

## Development

Espera is written in C#, with WPF as frontend.
